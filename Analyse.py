#Calculate the longest streak for a given habit.
def calculate_longest_streak_for_id(numb):
    """
    Calculates the longest streak(days or weeks in a row) for a given habit ID.

    This function first calls the get_all_habits() function and receives the habit data from the habit table and creates instances of the class Habit and puts them into a list.
    It then creates a dictionary using this list in order to seperate between daily and weekly habits.
    It then checks if there is at least one entry in the list when calling the get_progress_all function and if not returns (data from habits_progress table).
    After that it checks if there are habits with daily and/or weekly, and sets a check variable = True/False.
    Then it calls the get_check_off_dates function for the numbe parameter set -> receiving a list check_offs with dates in the date format.
    The check_off list is used for calculation.
    Depending if the number is in the dictionary connected with daily or weekly it starts the calculation.
    The longest_streak is at least one (because the number is in the habits_progress table)
    The current streak is also set to 1 and is updated with + 1 in the for loop until the time between the dates is more than 1 day/ 1 week.
    If the current streak is bigger it makes the current streak the new longest streak.
    If not it resets the current streak to 1 and starts again until it iterated threw the whole list of dates for the number.
