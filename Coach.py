        This function activates the coach and sends email to a given adress.

        The habit_name is received from the get_all_habits function.

        In the beginning the function first checks if the habit ID even exists (if not message displyed).
        It first checks if the habit ID is already in the activated_ids table by calling the activated_ids function.
        If not it calls the insert_habit_id function to store the ID into the activated_ids table from the database.
        
        After creating variables with the actual date and two to calculate the timedifference for 2 days and 1 week,
        it checks the periodicity from the habit by calling the get_periodicity_for_ID function (self.periodicity = get_periodicity_for_ID(habit_id)).
        Wether its daily or weekly it starts the calculation inside the respective if statement. 
        The calculation is the same with one differnce if the habit is weekly .
        If weekly it checks only on sunday to make sure you check off your weekly habit.
        First it receives all check-off times for the habit by calling the get_progress_by_ID function.
        It iterates through the check_off_times and checks if any of the check_off_times - 2 days (or 1 week) is smaller or equal the todays date.
        If there is none this means there is no check off for the last two days and the function creates an email using the yagmail library.
        It puts the name into the body of the email message and sends it to the receiver email.
        At the end a short message is displayed to let the user know it worked.

        Args:
